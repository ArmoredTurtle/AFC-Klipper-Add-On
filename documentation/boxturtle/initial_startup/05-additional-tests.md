## Further tests

### Respoolers

Run the ``TEST`` command against each lane (one at a time) to verify proper respooler operation:

- `TEST LANE=lane1`
- `TEST LANE=lane2`
- `TEST LANE=lane3`
- `TEST LANE=lane4`

Verify that each respooler works properly by moving in reverse like respooling a spool before proceeding.

### Trigger switches

Actuating the trigger switch should begin pulsing that lane's extruder motor to load filament. Verify that the switch
being actuated is activating that same lane's extruder motor. Between activating each trigger please allow 1-2 seconds 
before activating the next trigger.

Once all four lanes are confirmed to be activating the correct extruder when the trigger switch is actuated, move on to
the next step.

### Extruders

Insert filament into the feeder tube (it helps to cut it at an angle) and press through until the extruder motor gears
catch the filament and load it further. If you can press the filament through, but it feels like the extruder motor is
pushing back on the filament instead of pulling it in, try reversing the `dir_pin` setting for that extruder motor in
`AFC/AFC_Turtle_1.cfg`.

If you are able to load filament into all 4 lanes and get a green LED indicator, and `AFC_STATUS` at the console
reports no errors, move on to the next step.

### TurtleNeck buffer

Test that TurtleNeck buffer is configured correctly by extending the slide all the way out, then run
`QUERY_BUFFER BUFFER=Turtle_1`. This should return `Trailing (Expanded)`. Collapse the slide all the way so it 
triggers the
switch at the rear, then rerun the QUERY_BUFFER command. It should then report `Advancing (Compressed)`.

Confirm proper operation of your TurtleNeck before proceeding.
